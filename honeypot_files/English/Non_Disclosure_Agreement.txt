    c.  Limit access to Confidential Information to only those of its employees, consultants, or contractors who have a strict "need to know" for the Purpose and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as stringent as those set forth in this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any such individuals.
    d.  Exercise at least the same degree of care in protecting the Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.

**4. Exclusions from Confidential Information**
The obligations of non-disclosure and non-use set forth herein shall not apply to information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate:
    a.  Is or becomes publicly available through no fault or breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.

**5. Term of Confidentiality**
The obligations of confidentiality and non-use under this Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Date, or for as long as the information qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law, whichever is longer. The Agreement itself shall remain in effect until the confidentiality obligations for all Confidential Information disclosed have expired.

**6. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information**
Upon the Disclosing Party's written request, or upon the termination of discussions concerning the Purpose, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party or, at the Disclosing Party’s option, destroy all copies of Confidential Information (including all notes, summaries, analyses, and derivatives thereof) received from the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall provide written certification of such destruction upon request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain one archival copy of the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with legal or regulatory requirements.

**7. No License or Warranty**
No license or right, express or implied, is granted by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets, other than the limited right to use the Confidential Information for the Purpose. All Confidential Information is provided "AS IS," and the Disclosing Party makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding its accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose.

**8. Remedies**
The Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, to prevent any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement.

**9. Governing Law**
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
