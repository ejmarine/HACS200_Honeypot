INTERNAL USE ONLY

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join this critical update. For those who don't know me, I'm Dr. Evelyn Reed, your Chief Information Security Officer. Today, we're discussing the findings from our Q2 security audit – a cornerstone of our commitment to maintaining a robust and resilient security posture across the organization.

Overall, the audit presents a mixed picture. While we've seen significant improvements in several key areas, particularly around our perimeter defenses and incident response efficiency, it also highlighted specific vulnerabilities that require our immediate and concerted attention.

First, and consistently, the audit revealed a concerning persistence in human-element vulnerabilities. Our simulated phishing campaigns across several departments – notably Marketing and Human Resources – yielded higher-than-acceptable click-through rates, indicating a persistent susceptibility to social engineering attacks. This is a direct gateway for ransomware and data exfiltration.

Secondly, we identified notable inconsistencies in patch management and software update compliance. Several critical systems, particularly those managed within our EMEA operations and select R&D lab environments, are running outdated software versions, leaving exploitable gaps. These aren't just minor oversights; they represent known pathways for sophisticated threats.

Our review of access controls highlighted a degree of configuration drift in cloud environments and on-premise Active Directory. Specifically, we found instances of overly permissive access for inactive accounts and a lack of consistent multi-factor authentication enforcement for privileged users in some critical internal applications. This significantly elevates our insider threat risk.

Finally, the audit surfaced a recurring challenge with data classification and handling protocols, particularly concerning our intellectual property. A significant volume of highly sensitive data was found stored on non-approved platforms or shared via unencrypted channels, underscoring a critical awareness gap among some employees regarding our data governance policies.

Addressing these findings is not optional; it's fundamental to our operational continuity and regulatory compliance. I need each of you, as department heads and leaders, to review the detailed departmental reports that will be circulated immediately following this briefing. Your proactive engagement in prioritizing remediation efforts, allocating necessary resources, and reinforcing security best practices within your teams is paramount. We will be holding follow-up sessions to discuss specific action plans within the next two weeks.

Our collective security is a shared responsibility, not just the security team's. While these findings are sensitive and require swift action, I have full confidence in our ability to address them effectively and strengthen our defenses. The Security team is here to support you every step of the way. Thank you for your unwavering commitment to protecting our company.
