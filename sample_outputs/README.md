## üîÑ Generating Your Own

## üí° Tips for Review

When you generate your honey, check that it:
1. ‚úÖ Looks authentic (would you believe it's real at first glance?)
2. ‚úÖ Contains appropriate markers (CONFIDENTIAL, INTERNAL, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Has realistic details (names, dates, amounts)
4. ‚úÖ Matches the language/cultural context
5. ‚úÖ Varies in sensitivity (some more "valuable" than others)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember

All honey is **completely synthetic and fictional**. It's designed to:
- Attract attacker attention
- Waste attacker time
- Create false confidence
- Enable tracking and analysis

**Never use real data in honeypots!**
